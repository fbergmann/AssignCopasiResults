## Assign COPASI Results
This Repository contains a number of tools that make it easy to deal with incomplete parameter estimation runs from COPASI. All you need is a partial `parameter estimation report` and the `original COPASI file` that was used to run the parameter estimation. From here the tool can generate a new COPASI file with the found fit. 

For more information also see the [documentation](https://github.com/fbergmann/AssignCopasiResults/blob/master/2012-03-30_-_ApplyingCOPASIResults.pdf?raw=true).
